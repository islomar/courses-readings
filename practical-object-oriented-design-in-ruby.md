## Chapter 1: Object-Oriented Design
* Change is unavoidable.
* Object-oriented design is about **managing dependencies**.
* Design is thus an art, the art of arranging code.
* The purpose of design is to allow you to do design **later** and its primary goal is to reduce the cost of change.
* Object-oriented software fails when the act of design is separated from the act of programming.
* SOLID and design patterns.
* OO: 
    * messaging and encapsulation.
    * methodsd get invoked in response to messages
    * the *String* class, that is, the blueprint for new string objects, *is itself an object*. It's an instance of the *Class* class.

## Chapter 2: Designing Classes with a Single Responsibility
* Design is more the art of preserving changeability than it is the act of achieving perfection.
* Code should be TRUE: Transparent, Reasonable, Usable and Exemplary
* Classes should have a single responsibility.
* When everything in a class is related to its central purpose, the class is said to be *highly cohesive* or to have a single responsibility.
* SRP requires that a class be cohesive.
* Do not feel compelled to make design decisions prematurely: "What is the future cost of doing nothing today?"
* Hide instance variables: always wrap instance variables in accessor methods instead of directly referring to variables.
* Hide data structures
* Enforce Single Responsibility Everywhere: methods, like classes, should have a single responsibility.
* Classes that do one thing *isolate* that thing from the rest of your application. This isolation allows change without consequence and reuse without duplication.


## Chapter 3: Managing Dependencies
* To collaborate, an object must know something about others. *Knowing* creates a dependency.
* An object depends on another object if, when one object changes, the other might be forced to change in turn.
* CBO: Coupling Between Objects.
* Law of Demeter.
* Inject dependencies.
* If you cannot remove unnecessary dependencies, you should isolate them within your class.
* Isolate instance creation.
* Remove argument-order dependencies, e.g. using hashes for initialization arguments (hhmm...); you can even mix it: take a few fixed-order arguments, followed by an options hash.
* You can also completely remove the defaults from the constructor and isolate them inside of a separate wrapping method.
* Use factories: isolate all knowledge of the external interface in one place.
* Do not allow external dependencies to permeate your code; protect yourself by wrapping each in a method that is owned by your own application.
* Depend on things that change less often than you do:
    * Some classes are more likely than others to have changes in requirements
    * Concrete classes are more likely to change than abstract classes.
    * Changing a class that has many dependents will result in widespread consequences.
      

## Chapter 4: Creating Flexible Interfaces
* OO is *made up* of classes but *defined* by messages.
* Messages reflect the living, animated application.
* The conversation between objects takes place using their *interfaces*
* *Interfaces* can be:
    * Within a class (e.g. in Java).
    * Duck typing
* The public parts of a class are the stable parts; the private parts are the changeable parts.
* The design goal is to retain maximum future flexibility while writing only enough code to meet today's requirements.
* Public interfaces:
    * Reveail its primary responsibility
    * Are expected to be invoked by others
    * Will not change on a whim
    * Are safe for others to depend on
    * Are thoroughly documented in the tests
* It shows an example through sequence diagrams.
* You don't send messages because you have objects, you have objects because you send messages
* Tell don't ask.
* The best possible situation is for an object to be completely independent of its context.
* Construct public interfaces with an eye toward minimizing the context they require from others.
* Avoid train wrecks.
* Demeter: it might be not so bad to NOT avoid message chains that return *attributes* (balance the likelihood and cost of change against the cost of removing the violation)
* Certains "violations" of Demeter reduce your application's flexibility and maintainability, while others make perfect sense.
* The train wrecks of Demeter violations are clues that there are objects whose public interfaces are lacking.


## Chapter 5: Reducing Costs with Duck Typing
* Duck types are public interfaces that are not tied to any specific class.
* Concrete code is easy to undertstand but costly to extend. Abstract code may initially seem more obscure but, once understood, is far easier to change.
* Polymorphism in OOP referes to the ability of many different objects to responsd to the same message.
* Hidden ducks: Case statements, isInstanceOf()...
* Tests are the documentation for duck types.
* *Monkey patching*: changing base classes (watch out!!)
