## Chapter 1: Object-Oriented Design
* Change is unavoidable.
* Object-oriented design is about **managing dependencies**.
* Design is thus an art, the art of arranging code.
* The purpose of design is to allow you to do design **later** and its primary goal is to reduce the cost of change.
* Object-oriented software fails when the act of design is separated from the act of programming.
* OO: 
    * messaging and encapsulation.
    * methodsd get invoked in response to messages
    * the *String* class, that is, the blueprint for new string objects, *is itself an object*. It's an instance of the *Class* class.
