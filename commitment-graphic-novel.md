# Commitment: novel about managing project risk

https://commitment-thebook.com/

- The "only" things that the Financial Option maths can tell us about options are:
  - Options have values.
  - Options expire.
  - Never commit earlier unless you know why: committing to an option is when you decide to do something and it is no longer optional, but an obligation/commitment.
- The biggest problems is that most people see commitments which are actually options.
- An aversion to uncertainty means people make decisions early
- Delaying commitments gives decision makers more flexibility as they continue to have options. It allows them to manage risk / uncertainty using their options.
  - There is value in paying to defer a commitment.
- A **commitment** is something we _have to_ do. Things like tax, children and death.
- More than one person knows about one topic.
- It's motivating for a team to feel that they're doing quality work.
- Three kind of options
  - Financial options
    - Black-Scholes equation.
    - The buyer of the option willingly pays a premium for the option.
  - Embedded options
    - An option that occurs in a legal contract which was NOT specifically intended to be an optino. This is a clause in a contract that allows the buyer some flexibility as a kind of service.
    - Operational tolerance
  - Real options
    - They are options that exist outside of legal frameworks.
    - Black-Scholes and its derivative cannot be used to value real options.
    - Anything you can do without the obligation to do it is a real option.
- About relationships and knowledge options
  - Knowledge options are those pieces of information I know just enough of.
  - I learn enoug about a subject to understand what can be done with the tools, and how long it will take me to learn the tools to the point that I can apply them.
  - Knowledge options explictly acknowledge the value of being consciously incompetent.
  - Conscious competent model by Noel Burch, 1970.
- It is more important that the team know the status than the management does.
- **Slack**
  - It's better that people wait for work than the other way around.
  - The team members can use their slack time to thelp their colleagues and to think about general system improvements.

## InfoQ article: "Real Options" Underlie Agile Practices

- Real Options is about "deferring decisions to the last responsible moment," which is an explicit principle in the Lean Software approach.
  - TDD
  - Test doubles
  - Pairing
- When the client requests a feature the team is free to act, because they are not tied up working on unwanted features. This is only possible with short iterations and a fast turnaround on regression testing.
- There are two aspects to Real Options, the mathematics and the psychology.
  - The mathematics of Real Options, which is based on Financial Option Theory, provide us an optimal decision process
  - The psychology of uncertainty and decision making (based on Neuro Linguistic Programming and Cognitive Behavioural theory) tells us why people do not follow this optimal decision process and make irrational decisions as a result.
- Real Options are real world decisions.
- Rather than decisions, Real Options is really about commitments. Quite often people make a decision which becomes an emotional commitment to an idea. They do not realise that they can change their minds.
- There is value in paying to defer a commitment.
- An aversion to uncertainty means people make decisions early. Real Options address this aversion to uncertainty by defining the exact date or conditions to be met before the decision should be made.
  - Delaying commitments gives decision makers more flexibility as they continue to have options. It allows them to manage risk / uncertainty using their options.
- Real Options works most effectively if participants cooperate with each other. This goes against common practice of hiding our intent.
- Your most experienced team members with the most options (most skills etc.) should be allocated last. This means your most experienced staff can be deployed to address any emergent issues.
