## General information
* **Regions** are totally independent: a region is a collection of regional Data Centers.
* **VPC**: Virtual Private Cloud
  - Inside the VPCs we can have **subnets**.
  - We assign different subnets to different **availability zones** (an AZ are different Data Centers inside the same region).
