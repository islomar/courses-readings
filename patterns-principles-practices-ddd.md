## PART I. The principles and practices of Domain-Driven Design

### Chapter 1: what is Domain-Driven Design
* An **Analysis Model** is used to describe the logical design and structure of a software application. It is the represetnation of SW that non-technical people can conceptualize in order to understand how software is constructed.
* * The **Strategic Patterns** of DDD
    * **Core domain**
    * Focus effort and talent on the core **subdomain(s)**
    * **Ubiquitous Language** (UL)
    * **Bounded contexts**: it ensures that the **integrity** of the models is retained.
    * **Context maps**: relationship between bounded contexts.
* * The **Tactical Patterns** of DDD (aka *model building blocks*): collection of patterns that help to create effective models for complex bounded contexts.
* The **Strategic patterns** shape the solution, while **tactical patterns* are used to impliment a rich domain model. Strategic patterns can be useful for any application but tactical patterns are only useful if your model is sufficiently rich in domain logic.
* The **Problem Space** and the **Solution Space**
    * DDD's impact in the problem space is to reveal what is important and where to focus effort.
    * The solution side of DDD covers patterns that can shape the archictecture of your applications and make it easier to manage.
* Focus on the Core Domain: it's the unique selling point.
* Learning through collaboration between the development teams and business experts. Knowledge crunching.
* Creating models through exploration and experimentation: for every good design there must be at least three bad ones.
* Communication: the single **most important facet of DDD** is the creation of the UL, the ability to effectively describe a model built to represent a problem domain.
* Each context defines a **linguistic boundary**.
* Consntantly evolve the model.
* DDD is architecturally agnostic.
* DDD is a language- and domain-centric approach to software development.


### Chapter 2: Distilling the problem domain
* UL: apply a shared language rich in domain-specific terminology
* Domain experts vs Stakeholders
    * **Stakeholders** communicate the business goals and the inputs and outputs of the system. The system captures these as busines use cases.
* Patterns for **effective knowledge crunching**
    * Focus on the most interesting conversation.
        * Which parts of the system are hard to use?
        * Which manual processes stop you from doing more crateive, value-adding work?
    * Start from the Use Cases
    * **Powerful questions**
        * Where does teh need of this system come from?
        * How will this system give value to the business?
        * What would happen if this system wasn't built?
        * http://codebetter.com/gregyoung/2012/02/29/powerful-questions-2/
    * Sketching: keep your diagrams at a consistent level of detail
    * CRC: Class Responsability Collaboration Cards
    * Defer the naing of concepts in your model:
        * Premature naming can be a problem: selecting an existing word early in the process shapes our thinking.
        * http://codebetter.com/gregyoung/2012/02/28/the-gibberish-game-4/
        * If you find yourself appending *service* or *manager* to a class or concept, think more creatively.
    * Behaviour-Driven development
        * A **feature** describes a behavior that gives value to the business.
        * You write then several feature **stories** and **scenarios**
    * Rapid prototyping
        * Screen mock-ups
        * https://skillsmatter.com/podcast/open-source-dot-net/mystery-ddd
        * https://sourcemaking.com/antipatterns/analysis-paralysis
* Look for **existing models**
    * https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/85002.Analysis_Patterns
    * Ask for existing process maps and work flow diagrams to help you understand the domain at a deeper level
    * Don't be afraid of experimentation: there is not a correct model.
    * Event Storming
        * Domain event
        * Trigger for the event, e.g. user action (command), an external system, etc.
        * http://ziobrando.blogspot.co.uk
    * Impact Mapping
        * What impacts the business is trying to make?
        * Impact > Actors > Tasks
        * Create a mind-map-like diagram.
        * http://www.impactmapping.org
    * Business Model Canvas
    * Deliberate Discovery
        * https://dannorth.net/2010/08/30/introducing-deliberate-discovery/
        * Lear about areas of the problem domain that you are ignorat about
        * "Ignorance is the single greatest impediment to throughput"
    * Model Exploration Whirlpool
        * https://domainlanguage.com/ddd/whirlpool/
        * A method of modeling and knowledge crunching that can complement other agile methodologies.
        * It contains the following activities: scenario exploring, modeling, challenging the model, harvesting and documenting, code probing


### Chapter 3: Focusing on the Core Domain
* Don't blindly follow the users
* A **domain vision statement** can be created at the start of a project to explictly capture what is central to the success of the software, what the busines goal is, and where the value is.
* Don't get subdmoains confused with the organizational structure of a company. Subdomains represent areas of capability, define business processes, and represent the functionalyty of a system.
* Try not to bring technical concerns into conversation when you are analyzing the problem space.
* Domain types:
    * Generic domains 
        * E.g. reporting, notification; it does not define the application
        * Look to buy in software for them.
    * Core domains: 
        * the unique product offering from a rival's , what gives a competitive edge in the market
        * what makes your system work building?
    * Supporting domains: 
        * enablers for the core domain and the application
        * example for Amazon: browsing the catalog for products: it does not define it as a company and is not different from any other e-commerce site.
        * If possible, buy off-the-shelf solutions or do not invest heavily in these systems.
* Not al√± parts of asystem will be well designed
* Focus on clean boundaries over perfect models: **anticorruption layer**
* The core domain doesn't always have to be perfect the first time
* Build subdomains for replacement rather than reuse.


### Chapter 4: Model-Driven Design
* The **domain** (problem space) represents the problem area you are working withing. It is the "reality".
* The **domain model** (solution space) is abstraction of the problem domain, expressed as a acode impletementaion that represents a view, not the reality, of the problem.
* A **model** is represented as an analysis model and a code model. They are one and the same.
* The **analysis model** is a collection of artifacts that describe the model of a system. E.g. in UML.
* The **code model**: we should keep in in close synergy twith the analysis model, the design. E.g. sharing an UL.
    * The code model is the realization of the analysis model.
* **Model-Driven Design**:
    * it is the process of binding an analysis model to a code implementation model, ensuring that both stay in sync and are useful during evolution.
    * It differs from DDD in that is focused on implementation and any contraints that may require changes to an initial model, whereas **DDD focuses on language, collaboration, and domain knowledge**.
* The true value of follwing the DDD philosophy is in the collaboration of develoipers and domain experts to produce a better understanding of the domain. The code that is written is just an artifact of that process.    
* The UL should be clear and concise. Technical terms should be removed so they don't distract from business concepts.
* Keep linguistic consistency.
* Stay away from overloaded terms like poilcy, service or manager.
* A **specification** represetns a business rule that needs to be sastisfied by at least part of the domain model.
* The best way to create effective domain models is tofirstly focus on areas of the application that are important to the business.
* **A domin model is not a model of real life**. It is a system of abstractions on reality. It should exclude any irrelevant details of a domain that do not serve to solve problems.
* Try not to model real relationships; instead define associations (meaningful connections) in terms of invariannts and rules in the system.
* A domain model nees to be constantly refined to continually be useful.
* Adeveloper's purpose is not to code; it's to solve problems.
* Limit your abstractions: it is far better to be explicit than worry about not repeating yourself as trying to lie loosely related concepts under a super class can cause problems with code maintenance.
* Abstract behavior not implementations:
    * don't automatically abstract concepts that are related.
    * create abstract classes or interfaces based on behavior; keep them small and focused.
* Don't stop at the first good idea: 
    * constsantly refactor to your understanding of the problem domain.
    * A model is only useful for a moment in time; don't get attached to elegant designs.
* Try not to create a UL for everything. Areas and subdomains that are not complex will not benefit from a UL.



### Chapter 5: Domain Model Implementation Patterns
* The domain layer, at the hearf of your application, is the area of code that contains your domain model. It is isolated from infrastruture and presentation patterns.
* Some domain model patterns:
    * Domain model pattern
    * Transaction script
    * Table module

#### Domain model
* It is an OO model that incorporates both behavior and data.
* It incorporates business process and associations, rules, and rich domain logic.
* It is based on the premise that there is no database.
* Classes are free from infrastructure concerns and are completely persitence ignorant.
* You should focus on the verb and actions of a problem domain when modeling.
* In a domain model each object is responsible for a specific task. Objects work together to fulfill business use cases by delegating to each other.

#### Transaction Script
* It follows a procdural style of development rather than an OO approach.
* Useful for the parts of your domain that have little or no logic.
* Typically a single procedure is created for each of your business transactions.
* Problems when the application grows and the business logic complexities increase...


#### Table module
* It maps the oobject model to the database model. A single object represetnas a table or view in the database.
* The object is responsible for all persistence needs along with business logic behavior.
* Active Record
* Anemic Domain Model
    * Only useful when using functional programming.
* The model is OK for simpler parts of the domain that are isolated by a bounded context and that are simpley forms over data (CRUD).


### Chapter 6: Maintaining the Integrity of Domain Models with Bounded Contexts
* Bounded contexts enable a model to stay consistent and meaningful.
* Collaboration overhead and organization inefficiencies are major problems a monolithic model is likely to cause.
* Sometimes, a single physical entity in the problem domain can mistakenly be classified as a single concept in code.
    * E.g. a `product` or a `ticket` can be different in the Sales context and the Procurement context.
* Correlation IDs are used to join up the lifecycle of a physical entity that exists in multiple contexts (e.g. a product).
* When there are no boudnaries in the code, it is too easy for coupling to occur.
* Your domain model is not your enterprise model.
* Use bounded contexts to divide and conquer a large model
* A bounded context makes it explicit to teams what the model is responsible for and what is is not.
* A bounded context is first and foremost a linguistic boundary.
* One of the most important parts of DDD is the protection of boundaries.
* It is important when developing the application that you isolate models within bounded contexts to avoid the blurring of responhsibilities that can lead to code that resembles a BBoM.
* Bounded context help to organize code at a macro level.
* Business capabilities are often strong indicators of linguistic boundaries.
    * A **business capabilitiy** is a grouoing of people in an organization that collaborate on business processes made up of lower-level capabilities.
* Conway's Law
* Try to retain some communication between teams
    * Cross-team pair programming.
    * Regular sessions in which teams share with other development teams whtat they are working on.
    * Diagrams and lightweight documentation
* **Subdomains** represent the logical areas of a problem domain. They exist to distill the problem space and break down complexity.
    * They reflect the business capabilities of the business organizational structure.
* **Domain models** are built to fulfill the uses cases of each of th subdomains. Ideally there would be a one-to-one mapping between models and subdomains.
    * **Bounded contexts** exist in the *solution space*.
    * A bounded context is a concrete technical implementation that enforces boundaries between models within an appication.
* A subdomain could contain more than a single model and a model could span more than a single subdomain
* A *bounded context* owns the vertical slice of functionality from the presentation layer, through the donmain logic layer, on to the persistence
    * A bounded context is used to define the applicatibility of a model in the solution space.
* If a bounded context contains a supporting or generic domain with a low logic complexity, you might want to favor a more CRUD style of development.
* You can apply different architectural patterns to the different bounded contexts.
* A **composite UI** shows data from multiple bounded contexts on the same web page.
* **Autonomy** is a key charaectteristic of bounded contexts that isolates teams from external distractions, and isolates models from unrelated concepts.
* **A single team should own a bounded context**


### Chapter 7: Context mapping
* A context map should be simple enough to be understuood by domain experts and development teams alike.
* It is a high-level, han drawn diagram that communicates a holitic picture of the contexts in play.
* It must demonstrate the integration points and the flow of data between bounded contexts.
* It is vital to understand who is responsible for each context that is required to change and how this change will take place.
* **Common relationships between bounded contexts**:
    * **Anticorruption layer**
        * Used to avoid corruption and protect your model from external influences. The interface adapts and translates to the interface of the other ocntext.
    * **Shared kernel**
        * Sharing part of the model to ease integration between two teams working on two separate bounded contexts that have a lot of crossover in therms of domain concepts and logic.
        * To be used if you have two bounded contexts in the same subdomain that share a subset of domain logic.
    * **Open host service**    
        * If multiple consumers need the same transforrmation logic needed from our model, we can provide a set of services to expose the functinality of a context via a clear defined, explicit contract.
        * To communicate with me, here you have my API (support multiple clients)
    * Separate ways: when bounded contexts are too costly to integrate an other nontechnical methods can be found (e.g. user interfaces, manual processes).
    * Partnership: two teams that have a common goal
        * An upstream/downstream relationship: customer supplier (teams work together to create ana greed-uon interface that satisfies both; the customer part of the relationship is the downstream context) or conformist.       
* When drawing the context map, you can include the type of relationship
* **All the development teamns in the organization need to understand the context map**
* **The goal is to understand an communicate Ownership and Responsibility**
