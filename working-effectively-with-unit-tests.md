## Preface
There are many motivators for creating a test or several tests:
* validate the system
  - immediate feedback that things work as expected
  - prevent future regressions
* increase code-coverage
* enable refactoring
* document the behavior of the system
* your manager told you to
* Test Driven Development
  - improved design
  - breaking a problem up into smaller pieces
  - defining the "simplest thing that could possibly work"
* customer acceptance
* ping pong pair-programming


## Unit testing, a first example
* "Why do you test?: To create a tiny universe where the software exists to do one thing and do it well."
* Inline Setup: whenever it make sense to have things inside your own tiny test, remove it from the global setup.
* You should prefer DAMP (Descriptive And Maintainable Procedures) to DRY.
* Replace loops with individual tests
* "Programming is not about typing... it’s about thinking." –Rich Hickey
* Replace ObjectMother with DataBuilder

## Motivators
* Validate the system:
  - Immediate Feedback That Things Work as Expected
  - Prevent Future Regressions

## Types of tests
* Solitary unit tests
  - Never cross boundaries
  - The Class Under Test should be the only concrete class
  - Boundary definition: "...a database, a queue, another system..."
found in a test.
* Sociable unit tests: you use the real collaborators.

## Improving assertions
* Better one assertion per test
* Code should not only express how it works, but also why it’s been written in a particular way.
* If your test has an assertion, do not add any mock verifications.
* If your test verifies a mock, do not add any assertions.
* At most, 1 assertion per test.
* At most, 1 mock verification per test.
* When stubbing method return values, use the most generic argument matcher possible.
