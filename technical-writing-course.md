- **Transitions**: The most important transitions in technical writing are as follows:
  - however
  - therefore
  - for example

### Words

- **Define** new or unfamiliar terms
- Use terms **consistently**
- Use **acronyms** properly: on the initial use of an unfamiliar acronym within a document or a section, spell out the full term, and then put the acronym in parentheses. Put both the spelled-out version and the acronym in boldface.
  - Do not cycle back-and-forth between the acronym and the expanded version in the same document.
- Here are the guidelines for acronyms:
  - Don't define acronyms that would only be used a few times.
  - Do define acronyms that meet both of the following criteria:
  - The acronym is significantly shorter than the full term.
  - The acronym appears many times in the document.
- Disambiguate pronouns

### Active voice

- The vast majority of sentences in technical writing should be in active voice.
- Convert passive voice to active voice because active voice is usually clearer.
- Most readers mentally convert passive voice to active voice. Why subject your readers to extra processing time? By sticking to active voice, readers can skip the preprocessor stage and go straight to compilation.
- Passive voice obfuscates your ideas, turning sentences on their head. Passive voice reports action indirectly.
- Some passive voice sentences omit an actor altogether, which forces the reader to guess the actor's identity.
- Active voice is generally shorter than passive voice.

### Clear sentences

- In technical writing, clarity takes precedence over all other rules.
- Choose strong verbs: pick the right verb.
- Reduce imprecise, weak, or generic verbs, such as forms of be, have, occur, happen.
- Stronger verbs: trigger, generate, ensure, specify, omit, issue, declare.
- Reduce there is/there are
  - In the best case scenario, you may simply delete There is or There are
  - You can sometimes repair a There is or There are sentence by moving the true subject and true verb from the end of the sentence to the beginning.
  - In still other situations, writers start sentences with There is or There are to avoid the hassle of creating true subjects or verbs. If no subject exists, consider creating one.
- Minimize certain adjectives and adverbs
  - adjectives and adverbs can make technical documentation sound dangerously like marketing material.
  - Don't confuse educating your readers (technical writing) with publicizing or selling a product (marketing writing).

### Short sentences

- Focus each sentence on a single idea
- Convert some long sentences to lists
- Eliminate or reduce extraneous words: simplify the sentences, e.g.
  - "Now" instead of "At this point in time"
  - "Find" instead of "Determine the location of"
  - "Can" instead of "is able to"
  - "Although" instead of "In spite of the fact that"
  - "Clarifies" instead of "enhances the clarification of"
- Reduce subordinate clauses.
  - The following list (by no means complete) shows common words that introduce subordinate clauses:
    - which
    - that
    - because
    - whose
    - until
    - unless
    - since
  - Some subordinate clauses begin with a comma and some don't.
  - Do the subordinate clauses in a sentence extend the single idea or do they branch off into a separate idea? If the latter, consider dividing the offending subordinate clause(s) into separate sentences.
- Distinguish that from which
  - In the United States, reserve **which** for nonessential subordinate clauses, and use **that** for an essential subordinate clause that the sentence can't live without.
  - If you read a sentence aloud and hear a pause just before the subordinate clause, then use **which**. If you don't hear a pause, use **that**.
  - Place a comma before **which**; do not place a comma before **that**.
